# diary-js

Reworked version of zwa-diary-js. It's main purpose is for me to lear some basic web technologies.

# To-Dos

* add to github pages
* move to typescript
* try React
* divide scss to multiple files 
* try setting up working babel (there is some problem with async/await, so no babel currently)
