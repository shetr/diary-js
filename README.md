# diary-js

Reworked version of zwa-diary-js. It's main purpose is for me to lear some basic web technologies.
Deployed on [github pages](https://shetr.github.io/diary-js/).

# To-Dos

* move to typescript
* try React
* inject current version number to code
* divide scss to multiple files 
* try setting up working babel (there is some problem with async/await, so no babel currently)
* remove eslint - seems it's not needed
* maybe try source map ts files for better debuging
